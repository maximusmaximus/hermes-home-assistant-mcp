# Home Assistant MCP Integration Skill

Use this skill when interacting with, inspecting, or controlling devices, sensors, and automations in Home Assistant via the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server integration (`/api/mcp`).

## Architecture & Communication
Home Assistant exposes its Assist LLM API over Model Context Protocol using the Streamable HTTP transport.
- **Endpoint**: `http://<homeassistant-ip>:8123/api/mcp`
- **Protocol**: MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP (SSE)
- **Authentication**: Bearer token via `Authorization: Bearer ${MCP_HOMEASSISTANT_API_KEY}`

## Multi-Location Isolation & Anti-Bleed Architecture
In environments where cloud integrations (e.g. Tuya, Wyze, Ring) link accounts shared across multiple physical facilities or homes:
1. **Local Site Boundary**: This instance is strictly scoped to the local physical site.
2. **Server-Side Hardening**: The Home Assistant MCP server at `/api/mcp` is hardened via `exposed_entities` configuration (`expose_new: false`) so only local site entities are served to MCP.
3. **Agent Scope Enforcement**:
   - The agent's operational scope is strictly bounded to entities present in the live context snapshot. It has zero knowledge of, and must never speculate about, diff against, or query devices outside the active live context.
   - Broad commands (such as "turn on all lights" or "turn off the lights") must ALWAYS be resolved exclusively to local site groups.
   - Never issue global unconstrained entity calls.


## Core Operational Methodology: Context-First
Always use a **Context-First** workflow:
1. **Discover Current State**: Do not guess entity IDs, names, or device states. Call `homeassistant__GetLiveContext` to get a real-time snapshot of the home's devices, domains, areas, and current sensor readings.
2. **Filter & Match**: Search the context snapshot for the user's target device or area (e.g. `McFridge Temperature`, `ParkingLot Humidity`, `Kitchen Lights`, `Bedroom Lights`).
3. **Site Verification**: Verify the candidate device is an authorized local site device before executing actions.
4. **Execute Action**: Call the appropriate tool (`intent__HassTurnOn`, `intent__HassTurnOff`, `light__HassLightSet`, etc.) with the exact name or area from the context.
5. **Confirm & Report**: State clearly what action was taken or report the requested telemetry concisely with units (e.g. `°F`, `%`).

## Available Tools

### Context & Information
- `homeassistant__GetLiveContext`: Provides real-time information about the CURRENT state, value, or mode of devices, sensors, entities, or areas. Optional filters: `name`, `domain`, `area`.
- `llm__GetDateTime`: Provides the current date and time from the Home Assistant server.

### Device Control
- `intent__HassTurnOn`: Turns on, opens, or activates a device or entity. (For locks, performs a 'lock' action). Arguments: `name` (string), `area` (string), `device_class` (string).
- `intent__HassTurnOff`: Turns off, closes, or deactivates a device or entity. (For locks, performs an 'unlock' action). Arguments: `name` (string), `area` (string), `device_class` (string).
- `light__HassLightSet`: Sets brightness percentage (0-100) or color of a light. Arguments: `name`, `brightness`, `color`.

### Media & Entertainment
- `media_player__HassMediaPause` / `media_player__HassMediaUnpause`
- `media_player__HassMediaNext` / `media_player__HassMediaPrevious`
- `media_player__HassSetVolume` / `media_player__HassSetVolumeRelative`
- `media_player__HassMediaPlayerMute` / `media_player__HassMediaPlayerUnmute`
- `media_player__HassMediaSearchAndPlay`

### Productivity & Timers
- `todo__get_items`: Query items on a to-do list (e.g. `Shopping list`).
- `todo__HassListAddItem`: Add an item to a to-do list.
- `todo__HassListCompleteItem`: Mark an item completed.
- `todo__HassListRemoveItem`: Remove items from a to-do list.
- `intent__HassCancelAllTimers`: Cancels all active timers.

### Notifications
- `assist_satellite__HassBroadcast`: Broadcast a spoken message through satellite speakers in the home.

## Safety Directives
- Never toggle security or lock devices unless explicitly commanded.
- Never repeatedly spam command endpoints if a device reports `unavailable`.
- Always report temperature and humidity telemetry with their respective measurement units.
- Never manipulate devices at external facilities.
